# tsg_crispr_screen_survey
The following is code used in the analysis and figure generation of our project titled "Discovery of novel tumor suppressors from CRISPR screens reveals lipid-sensitive subtype of AML"

## Functions and packages
Each R script points to a functions file that contains R functions and libraries used in this project. Through the evolution of the project, not all functions and libraries were used within analysis and plot code.

## Figure generation code
R scripts each have a corresponding markdown html file for easy display of generated code. Figure code has both main and supplementary figures attached. Majority of figures have been preassigned, however during development of the manuscript some figures were shifted around. 

## Analysis code
R scripts each have a corresponding markdown html file for easy display of generated code. 

## Data
Data files are incomplete due to file size limits. Smaller calculated tables are included in the repo.
